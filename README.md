# FEC-contribution-Analysis-with-R
By analyzing Pensylvania’s financial contribution data, I found several interesting trends: .It is no doubt that Pensylvania is a swing state.The contributions by number and amounts suggest it is a blue state but the election results contradict that fact. .Few candidates collected the most donations. .Female donors tend to donate more to liberals and/or to female candidate. .The retired people are the largest contribution group by no of donations and the total amount. It is very intresting to note that the top two occupations by number of contributions is Retired and unemployed. .Bernard Sanders gained more popularity than Hillary Clinton until he gave up his run. Donald Trump also haven’t raised as much as Ted Cruz and Rubio until they dropped off. This hints that at least Pennsylvania voters didn’t get their favorite candidate as the primary winner in both parties
